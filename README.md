### 2. AI Tool Usage

I used **ChatGPT** throughout the project primarily for:

- Generating initial API and front-end code snippets.
- Fixing issues such as CORS errors when making API calls.
- AI helped refactor CSS to Bootstrap classes for a cleaner UI and responsiveness.
- Suggesting best practices for REST API design.


### 3. Challenges and Solutions

- Challenge: Managing task state without a database.
Solution: Used a JSON file to persist data on the server.

- Challenge: Handling async updates and UI refresh smoothly.
Solution: Used fetch API with promises and clean DOM updates on each action.

- Challenge: Ensuring responsive design without complex CSS.
Solution: Adopted Bootstrap 5, reducing custom CSS and improving cross-device compatibility.
